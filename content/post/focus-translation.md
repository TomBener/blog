<!--- Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi wrote that “few things are sadder than encountering a person who knows exactly what he should do, yet cannot muster enough energy to do it.” Why don’t we do what we know needs to get done? Why is it so hard to concentrate and finish what we start? In our digital age, is there any hope of “mustering enough energy” to stay focused on what really matters so we can live the lives we want? In this article, you’ll learn tools and strategies to finally get, and stay, focused. This guide is for people who want to harness the power of focus, but don’t have a lot of time. Over this 15-minute read, you’ll get answers to: -->

心理学家 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi 写道，「没有什么比明确知道自己要什么事，但却没有足够的精力去做，更加让人难过了」[^1]。为什么我们不能专注地做自己需要完成的事？为什么集中精力完成一件事如此之难？在数字时代，我们还有没有希望「充分集中精力」专注于真正重要的事情，并因此过上我们想要的生活？在这篇文章中，你将学习到一些工具和策略，来帮助自己保持专注。这份指南的目标读者是那些想要充分利用专注力但总感觉时间不够用的朋友，通过大约 15 分钟的阅读，你会得到这两个问题的答案：

<!--- ## I can’t focus. Why? -->

## 为什么我们不能集中注意力？

<!--- Csikszentmihalyi argues that intense focus is possible only when a person has clear goals and the capacity to complete the tasks necessary to achieve them. Focus not only requires the ability to do the tasks at hand, but also the ability to deal with distractions that may take you off track. The trouble is, even though you may have the capacity to complete a task, you may not be able to avoid distraction and focus. While endless smart phone checking is a symptom of the problem, it is not the root cause of why you find it hard to focus. You ultimately can’t blame your phone for that promotion you didn’t get or the fact you stayed in bed scrolling Instagram instead of going to the gym. To learn how to focus, you must adopt new skills as well as understand the most common causes of distraction. There are several reasons why it’s hard to focus: -->

Csikszentmihalyi 认为，只有当人们有明确的目标，并且有能力完成实现目标所需的任务时，才有可能完全集中注意力[^2]。集中注意力不仅要求你有能力完成手头上的任务，还要有能力处理那些可能会让你分心的干扰事项。问题恰恰就在于此，即使你有能力完成某一项任务，但可能无法避免分心，导致难以集中精力。尽管不停拿起手机是一种外在表现，但这并不是你难以集中注意力的根本原因，不能因为你无法保持专注，或者躺在床上刷 Instagram 而没有去健身房，就责怪自己的手机。为了学习如何集中注意力，你必须采用新的方式，同时了解常见的导致分心的原因。难以集中精力通常有以下几方面原因。

<!--- ### You’re Stuck in an Unhealthy Rut -->

### 陷入不健康的习惯

<!--- In a [University College London study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170221101016.htm), participants were asked to sit at a computer and direct a cloud of dots. They were instructed to move a lever to the right if a dot cloud was moving right and to the left if a dot cloud was moving left. Participants did this with accuracy. That is, until researchers added a weight to one side of the lever making it harder to move one way. The result? Participants began moving the lever in the wrong, yet easier, direction. As the task became more difficult, participants subconsciously changed how they played the game. This study supports research from evolutionary biologists who argue humans have evolved to avoid energy consuming tasks by taking the path of least resistance. Doing what we know we should do is often hard. If we fall into a routine of avoiding discomfort by taking too many breaks, we learn it’s easier to break our focus than do what we know we should. As the dot study shows, we quickly learn how to avoid discomfort by changing the game. Henry Ford said, “Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason so few engage in it.” If checking email for a quick minute takes the pressure off having to think through a big assignment at work, you’ll keep clicking away if you don’t have the tools to realize and deal with the difficulty. If you don’t change your ways, you’ll soon carve a mental rut that teaches your brain to automatically escape hard work instead of working through it. -->

在 [伦敦大学学院的一项研究](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170221101016.htm) 中，参与者被要求坐在电脑前指挥一团圆点[^3]，他们的任务很简单：如果这团圆点向右移动，他们就将杠杆也向右移动，如果圆点向左移动，就将杠杆也向左移动，参与者都非常准确地完成了此项任务。然而，当研究人员在杠杆的一侧增加一个单位的重量使其难以单向移动之后，参与者们开始将杠杆朝着错误的但更容易的方向移动。也就是说，随着任务难度的提高，参与者下意识地改变了其参与游戏的方式。这项研究支持了进化生物学家的研究，他们认为**人类的进化让我们总是通过阻力最小的方式来避免消耗能量的任务**[^4]。完成自己应该做的事情通常是困难的，如果习惯于通过不停的休息来避免不适，我们会发现打破专注的状态比完成应该做的事情更加容易，正如圆点实验的结果那样，我们很快就学会了如何通过改变游戏规则来避免不适。亨利 · 福特说过「思考是最难的工作，这可能就是为什么很少有人从事这项工作的原因」，如果花几分钟查看邮件可以暂时摆脱繁琐工作的压力，并且没有工具帮助你意识到并处理工作中的困难，你就会一直点击邮件。如果不改变这种工作方式，你很快就会形成一种思维定势，这种定势会让大脑自动逃避困难的工作，而不是主动去解决它。

<!--- ### You Don’t Know How to Focus on Things You Dislike -->

### 不知道如何专注于自己不喜欢的事情

<!--- If you like doing something, you are more likely to do it. If you enjoy shopping for instance, you’ll seek out opportunities for “retail therapy.” However, if you find shopping to be a burden, you will avoid it unless absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, many things you need to do in life aren’t particularly enjoyable. Few people enjoy doing their taxes, but they need to get it done nonetheless. When you don’t enjoy a task, you’re more likely to seek an escape and lose focus. How then, do you stay focused doing something you dislike? Ian Bogost, a professor at Georgia Tech and a professional video game designer, argues that we have the power to reimagine tasks to make them more enjoyable. In his book, _Play Anything_, Bogost challenges readers to tackle everyday tasks with the same discipline and focus used to play a game. Bogost states that we should focus more intensely on the task at hand rather than concentrating on the end result or reward. Bogost highlights this theory using his attempt to make lawn mowing more enjoyable. To learn to enjoy the job of cutting his grass, Bogost focused more intensely on it. He learned everything he could about the practice and challenge himself to find the variability in the activity. For instance, he sought to find the optimal path for cutting the grass or beating his previous time. By reimagining a task, you can make anything more enjoyable and intrinsically rewarding. -->

如果喜欢做某件事，你就更有可能去做它。例如，如果你喜欢购物，你就会主动寻找「购物疗法」的机会。然而，如果你觉得购物是一种负担，你就会尽量避免，除非绝对必要。不幸的是，生活中要做的很多事情并不令人十分愉快，比如很少有人喜欢纳税，但即便如此，人们仍然需要纳税。当你不喜欢一项任务时，你更有可能选择逃避它，而不是集中精力去完成它。那么，应该如何集中精力做你不喜欢的事情的呢？乔治亚理工学院教授、专业视频游戏设计师 Ian Bogost 认为，我们可以重新想象生活中的任务，让它们变得更加有趣[^5]。在他的书《Play Anything》中，Ian Bogost 向读者发出一项挑战，让他们用玩游戏时的原则和专注来处理日常事务。Ian Bogost 指出，**我们应该更加专注于手头上的任务，而不是专注于最终的结果或奖励**。在书中，Ian Bogost 通过使修剪草坪变得更加愉快来说明这一理论，为了学会享受修剪草坪的过程，Ian Bogost 更加专注于割草，他学习所有他能学到的关于割草的知识，并让自己去发现修剪草坪活动中的各种变化，例如他尝试探索修剪草坪的最优路径或者缩短修剪草坪的时间。通过重新构想任务，你可以让任何事情都变得更加有趣、更有价值。

<!--- ### You’re Telling Yourself You “Don’t Have Time” -->

### 你总是告诉自己「我没时间」

<!--- In a Monthly Labor Review study, participants who reported working between 65-74 hours a week overestimated their work week by approximately 20 hours. Too often, people confuse being productive with being busy. However, there is evidence to suggest that “being too busy” to work on your goals indicates a lack of focus, not a lack of time. Henry Ford said, “It has been my observation that most people get ahead during the time that others waste.” Everyday, we choose how to spend our time. Wake up early, or hit the snooze? Take that part-time course or leave it for next month? Put clothes away now, or let them pile up? If everyone has the same 24-hours in their day, why are some people able to accomplish so much more? Research shows that the secret to time-management might not such a secret after all. Laura Vanderkam, time management and productivity author, has found that the most productive people are not time management wizards, rather, they are highly skilled at setting priorities. Highly productive people have a limited, focused list of what they want to accomplish and allocate time accordingly. She argues that the “I don’t have time excuse” is a passive way of admitting something “is not one of my priorities.” -->

在一项月度劳动评估研究中，每周工作 65-74 小时的参与者将他们的工作时间高估了大约 20 小时[^6]，这说明在很多情况下，人们把高效和忙碌混为一谈[^7]。然而，有证据表明，「太忙」导致不能按时完成任务表明你缺少专注力，而不是缺少时间。亨利 · 福特曾说「据我观察，大多数人都是在别人浪费掉的时间里获得成功。」每天，我们都在选择如何度过时间，早点起床，还是按下闹钟接着睡觉？立即去参加兼职课程，还是下个月再去？把衣服收拾整齐，还是让它们堆在那里？既然每个人每天都有相同的 24 小时，为什么有些人能够完成如此多的工作？研究表明，时间管理的秘密可能根本就不是什么秘密。时间管理者和生产力作家 Laura Vanderkam 发现，最高效的人并不是时间管理大师，相反，他们非常善于设定优先事项[^8]，高效率的人有一个有限的重点清单，记录着他们想要完成的任务，并分配相应的时间。她认为「我没时间的借口」是一种承认「这不是我优先考虑的事情」的一种被动方式。

<!--- In a 2018 study on the top productivity technique, researchers found that the number one secret to time management was deciding what you want to do and when you want to do it. This method of time management is frequently referred to as “timeboxing.” By designated parts of your day for certain tasks, you become more likely to use your time the way you intended. You replace time that you’re likely to get distracted by with meaningful activities that propel you towards your goals. Effective timeboxing starts with allocating time for what matters most. In the next sections, we’ll dive into how to get and stay focused. -->

在 2018 年一项关于高效率技巧的研究中，研究人员发现，时间管理的首要秘诀是决定你想做什么以及什么时候去做[^9]，这种时间管理方法通常被称为「时间块」（timeboxing）。通过指定一天中特定时间段内完成特定任务，你就更有可能按照预期的方式利用时间。通过这种方式，你可以把富有意义的活动分配到那些可能让你分心的时间段里，这些活动能够推动你朝着目标前进，有效的时间块始于为最重要的事情分配时间。接下来，我们将深入探讨如何才能保持专注。

现在你已经清楚地了解了导致人们无法集中精力的原因，那么下面就是学习克服分心的工具和技巧的时候了。以下是如何充分利用你的时间并保持专注的方法。

<!--- ### Complain Better -->

### 更好地抱怨

<!--- _Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ author, Dr. Travis Bradberry, argues that frequent complaining is a detrimental habit that can – and should – be broken. Complaining releases the stress hormone cortisol which negatively affects mood, reduces energy levels, and can ironically lead to more of the uncomfortable emotions we seek to escape through distractions. -->

Emotional Intelligence 2.0 的作者 Travis Bradberry 博士认为，经常抱怨是一种有害的习惯，这种习惯可以而且应该被打破。抱怨会释放压力荷尔蒙皮质醇，它会对情绪产生负面影响，降低能量水平，讽刺的是，这会导致我们通过分心来逃避不舒服的情绪[^10]。

[^10]: Travis Bradberry, “How Complaining Rewires Your Brain For Negativity,” HuffPost, December 28, 2017, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-complaining-rewires-y_n_13634470.

<!--- It’s time to learn how to complain better. Instead of complaining by focusing on the problem, Bradberry suggests adopting a “solution-oriented” approach. -->

如何学会更好地抱怨？Bradberry 博士建议采取「解决方案为导向」的方法，而不是通过关注问题来抱怨。

<!--- Next time you feel the urge to complain about a looming deadline or difficult task, stop to consider the real source of the problem. For instance, ask yourself whether a solution to the problem of not wanting to do a task can be found in changing your perception of the work. If so, changing your mind proves much easier and healthier than trying to avoid it. A little [self awareness through introspection](https://www.nirandfar.com/introspection/) can go a long way. -->

下次当你想要抱怨迫在眉睫的最后期限或繁重的工作时，冷静下来思考一下问题的真正根源。例如，问问你自己，是不是可以通过改变你对工作的看法来解决不想做某件事的问题，如果是这样的话，改变想法比刻意逃避更容易，也更加健康，通过内省来获得一些自我意识会有很大的帮助。

<!--- ### Schedule Your Indulgences -->

### 安排你的放纵

<!--- In a 1992 study, researchers found that participants who cited being unable to lose weight despite dieting underestimated their daily caloric intake by 47%. These same participants overestimated their daily activity level by 51%. This study suggests that we have a tendency to overestimate behaviors we know to be good for us – how much we exercise, how healthy we eat, how often we clean our homes. We do the opposite when it comes to behaviors we know have detrimental effects – [alcohol consumption](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9854438/Moderate-drinkers-underestimate-alcohol-use-by-40-per-cent-says-health-chief.html), sugar intake, and monthly entertainment spending. While frivolous indulgences are satisfying in the short-term, they tend to move us away from what we really want. An episode of TV can feel relaxing and satisfying. But what happens after one, two, three…? One episode feels good. A whole series can fill you with regret. When it comes to indulgences, there’s nothing wrong with enjoying yourself. However, the key to moderation is intent. By setting aside time for the things likely to distract you, you ensure to control them instead of letting them control you. Instead of watching television or scrolling social media whenever the urge strikes, put that activity on your calendar, just as you would timebox any task. By planning ahead, you give yourself the peace of mind knowing you’ll soon have time for something fun, without being taken off track when you want to stay focused. -->

在 1992 年的一项研究中，研究人员发现，那些声称自己正在节食，但却无法减肥的参与者将他们每天摄入的卡路里量低估了 47% [^11]。这项研究表明，人们往往会高估对自己有益的行为，例如运动量、饮食健康程度、打扫房间的频率等。相反，当涉及到众所周知具有不利影响的行为时，例如 [饮酒量](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9854438/Moderate-drinkers-underestimate-alcohol-use-by-40-per-cent-says-health-chief.html)、糖分摄入量和娱乐消遣的时间，人们倾向于低估其负面影响[^12]。虽然不必要的放纵在短期内让人感到非常满足，但这些行为会让我们与真正想要的东西渐行渐远。看一集电视节目会让你感到放松和满足，但一集、两集、三集之后呢？看一集感觉不错，看完整个系列可能会让你后悔不已。当谈及放纵时，尽情享受并没有什么错，而关键在于有意识的自我控制。为那些可能让你分心的事情留出时间，你要确保控制它们，而不是让它们控制你。**不要一有冲动就看电视或者刷社交媒体，而应该把这些活动安排在你的日程中**，就像你会把任何任务都安排在时间块里一样。通过提前计划，你就会拥有平静的内心，因为你知道很快就会有一段专门的时间来做一些有趣的事情，当你专注于一件事时，就不会跑去干其他事情。

<!--- ### Master Your Triggers -->

### 了解分心的诱因

<!--- In a George Mason University study, researchers found that distractions have a negative impact on the quantity and quality of our work. During the study, 54 participants were asked to outline and write essays on three different topics. Researchers found that interruptions negatively affected both the quality and quantity of work produced. This study supports research that distractions eat up time as well as decrease quality of work. According to one University of California study, it takes approximately twenty-three minutes to get back on track after being distracted. Triggers to distraction come in two categories – Internal Triggers and External Triggers. Getting and staying focused requires understanding and mastering both. -->

在乔治梅森大学的一项研究中，研究人员发现，分心会对人们工作的数量和质量产生负面影响[^13]。在该研究中，54 名参与者被要求就三个不同的主题撰写文章。研究人员发现，分心会对工作的质量和数量产生负面影响，这项研究证明，分心不仅会浪费时间，还会降低工作质量。根据加利福尼亚大学的一项研究，**分心后大约需要 23 分钟才能重新集中注意力**[^14]。分心的诱因有两类——内在诱因和外在诱因，需要了解并掌握它们才能保持持续的专注。

![Triggers prompt both traction and distraction.](https://www.nirandfar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Indistractable-traction-distraction-triggers-diagram-1024x1024.jpg)

<!--- _External Triggers:_ Cellphones, work colleagues, and even our kids, can all take us off track when we planned to focus. These triggers in our environment are called “external triggers.” External triggers are relatively easy to control – turn your phone off, logout of social media, put a sign on your computer monitor telling colleagues you’re busy, and so on. Internal triggers, on the other hand, are more difficult to recognize and correct. _Internal Triggers:_ Internal triggers come from within. They are uncomfortable emotional states you seek to escape. Understanding the internal triggers driving you to distraction is critical to staying focused. When do you feel the urge to check your phone? Do you check it when you feel lonely? Bored? Anxious? Overwhelmed? If so, what’s the source of these negative emotions? Reflecting on why you get distracted and learning healthier ways to respond is an integral part of developing sustained focus. While you may be unable to control what you feel, you are able to put practices in place to help guide what you do in response to the desire to escape into distraction. Is your habit of falling out of focus when you feel a negative emotion helping or hampering your ability to stay focused? If you are honest about why you become distracted and understand your negative emotions, you can respond in a healthier way in line with your values and goals. -->

手机，同事，甚至是孩子，都会让我们在想要专注时难以集中注意力，周围环境中的这些诱因被称为「**外在诱因**」。外在诱因相对来说比较容易控制：关掉手机，退出社交媒体，在电脑显示屏上放一个便签告诉同事你很忙，等等。另一方面，「**内在诱因**」则更难识别和纠正，内在诱因来自于我们自己，例如你想要逃避的不舒服的情绪状态。理解内在诱因如何使你分心是保持专注的关键。你什么时候有拿起手机的冲动？当你感到孤独、无聊、焦虑还是不知所措的时候，你会不停地刷手机？如果是这样的话，这些负面情绪的来源是什么？反思自己为什么会分心，并学会用更健康的应对方式是持续集中精力的重要部分。虽然可能无法控制自己的感受，但是你可以通过实践来指导自己如何应对逃避干扰的想法。当你感到一种消极情绪帮助或阻碍了你集中注意力的能力时，你是否习惯于分散注意力？如果一五一十地告诉自己为什么会分心，并理解自己的负面情绪，你就可以根据自己的价值观和目标，以更健康的方式做出应对。

<!--- Becoming indistractable requires an understanding of why you lose focus and learning the skills to do as you say. Establishing healthy habits, breaking out of your unproductive routines, and making time for what matters help you stay focused. By learning not to complain, scheduling indulgences, and understanding your internal triggers, you can harness the power to stay focused. -->

进入不受干扰的专注状态，需要理解为什么你会难以集中注意力，并学会按照本文的技巧去实践。养成健康的习惯，克服自己的低效习惯，为重要的事情腾出时间，有助于你保持专注。通过学会不抱怨，安排放纵的时间，理解分心的内在诱因，你可以利用这些方式来保持专注。
