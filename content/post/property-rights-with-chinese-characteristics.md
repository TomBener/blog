There is no denying that nobody can fully secure his or her properties in
mainland China. Why? Because the Big Brother—Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is
always watching you. And above all, it has the absolute control and power of all
aspects of the China society. And the history of human beings has clearly shown
that the absolute power is a disaster.

Zhai Shanying, a former Chinese businessman whose grandfather was a general of
the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Nevertheless, he now is a criticizer of CCP
and has *run* out of China to the U.S. Zhai
[summarized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrU1X9j78_k) three defects of CCP:

- In CCP’s hierarchical system, subordinates must submit to the consciousness of
  superiors.
- There is absolutely nobody within the system is willing to take responsibility for
  any problems caused by its leadership mistakes.
- No matter the party collective or the individual, they are
  desperate to take possession of the good things they see to be owned by the party
  or its members.

The last defect is the most important one in my eyes, and I named it as
“Property Rights with Chinese Characteristics”.

We all know that all Chinese problems lie in the Chinese Communist Party. But
the party is never willing to “seek benefits for Chinese people” as it
propagated. Instead, it’s real responsibility is to maintain the interest of the
party itself. Put it differently, only for *Zhao Jia Ren*, not for *Zhong Guo
Ren*. As the historian [Frank Dikötter][wirechina] commented:

> Surely now we can also see that the goal of reform was to increase the control
> of the party over the commanding heights of the economy and not let go of it.
> In other words, the party does control capital. It does control energy. It
> does own the land. It’s never really let go of any of it.

In China, it’s not true that private property rights are not important as some
China watchers concluded. Instead, Chinese people under CCP have never obtained
private property rights all the time. To some extend, Deng Xiaoping’s flagship
“Opening up and Reform” is a kind of “privatization” of state-owned properties,
but it’s not a real privatization. Because the party has the absolute power to
revert the reform, which has been witnessed in the last ten years since Xi
Jinping came to power. And this is the [dictatorship][aftermao]:

> Politics is about power and what to do with it: should it be divided among
> different institutions, with checks and balances, an increasingly complex
> civil society and an independent media to constrain abuse, or should it be
> concentrated in the hands of one individual or single party? The former is
> termed a democracy, the latter a dictatorship.

Advocating private property rights does not mean we must against public property
rights. But the awareness of protecting private property is one the most
prominent factors for the development. Unfortunately, the situation is getting
worse and worse in recent years, especially under the brutal zero-covid policy.

There is a saying circulating in the Chinese internet:

> The freedom is a kind of thing that not important generally. Only when the
> freedom is lost, can you realize its significance. Freedom cannot be ate, but
> without it, you would not be able to eat.

The same pattern is true for private property rights. As Frank Dikötter said
again:

> Without political reform, market reform cannot exist. The argument over
> whether trade can or should be ‘free’ misses the key point, namely that a
> market without the rule of law, backed up by an independent judicial system
> and a free and open press, is not much of a market at all. **There is no
> economic freedom without political freedom**. Politics determines the nature of
> economics, not the other way around.
